# GDream 🌙

**GDream** is a specialized real-time companion for the **Archer class only** in *Mobinogi*.  
It quietly observes each shot fired, every moment of precision — and transforms them into a dreamlike performance on screen.

> ⚠️ **This tool works exclusively for Archers.** Other classes are not supported for now.
